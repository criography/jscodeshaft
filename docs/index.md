# JSCodeShaft 

A collection of common helpers building on top of the excellent [jscodeshift](facebook/jscodeshift) and [recast](benjamn/recast). Its primary goal is to assist migrations and refactors or React codebases, with a focus on design systems.

While it's used in production, it's a very slow WIP, so keep that in mind if you want to use it yourself.
